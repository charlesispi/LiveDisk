LiveDisk is a simple Windows tool to monitor disk space live, without having to right click and refresh. It natively supports Windows 7-10. It supports any kind of disk and allows displaying in Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, and Terabytes.

## Live Space Updating
Are you worried that this big install might fail because of your almost free drive? (*cough* CUDA *cough*) Well, just use LiveDisk to watch how much space you have left live. And yes, it is live, it updates every 5 milliseconds.

## Space Monitoring
You can use the "Monitor" tool to watch how much your space changes from when you turn it on.

## Simplicity
It is super simple to use and is tiny in size. It barely uses any CPU (at least for me). It isn't filled with ads asking to pay $40 or anything like that. It's completely free and open source and it will stay like that.

# Installation
You can install using the zip file or the installer exe, no Python install required.
**Zip File:**
Extract all and run "LiveDisk.exe"
**Exe Installer:**
Run the installer and go through setup process.

That's pretty much it! Enjoy!
